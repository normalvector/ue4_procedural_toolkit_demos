/// *ActorComponent* for easy geometry deformation.
///
/// This is the main class for the *Mesh Deformation Component*, and
/// provides an *ActorComponent* which can be attached to a UE4 Actor to
/// give access to the feature.
///
/// This includes the basic functionality to:
/// * Load geometry data and store it in the component
/// * Select vertices
/// * Apply transformations (Much of this is a delegate
///   to *MeshGeometry* and just repeated here so that we
///   can call the function on the component)
/// * Output the result to a *ProceduralMeshComponent*.
///
/// ## Use of SelectionSet to control Weighting
///
/// All of the transformation functions can take an optional *SelectionSet*
/// which allows the strength of the effect to be controlled on a per-vertex
/// basis, with 0=No effect, 1=Full effect, and values in between meaning partial
/// effect.  Values less than <0 or >1 can be provided but the effects are not guaranteed
/// to be sensible.
///
/// Each transformation function tries to handle the SelectionSet as a linear interpolation
/// in a sensible manner, but this can change depending on the nature of the function.
/// For example *Translate* can treat the weighting as a lerp factor between the points original
/// position and the translation target, but *Rotate* needs to apply their blending to the actual
/// angle of rotation.  If in doubt look at the actual implementation for the function in
/// *MeshGeometry*.
